# PokeMart

A full stack web application for pokemon fans who want to experience an ecommerce site that emulates a Pokemart.

## Why I built this project: 

I created this project to combine my full-stack development skills with my passion for Pok√©mon in a fun and creative way. Building a PokeMart as an e-commerce site not only allowed me to demonstrate my technical expertise but also gave me the opportunity to infuse the project with a sense of nostalgia and enjoyment!
